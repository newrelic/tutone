Code generation tool

Generate code from GraphQL schema introspection.

## Summary

At a high level, the following workflow is used to generate code.

-   `tutone fetch` calls the NerdGraph API to introspect the schema.
-   The schema is cached in `schema.json`.  This is information about the GraphQL schema
-   `tutone generate` uses the `schema.json` + the configuration + the templates to output generated text.

## Getting Started

1.  Create a project configuration file, see `configs/tutone.yaml` for an example.
2.  Generate a `schema.json` using the following command:

    ```bash
    $ tutone fetch \
      --config path/to/tutone.yaml \
      --cache \
      --output path/to/schema.json
    ```

3.  Add a `./path/to/package/typegen.yaml` configuration with the type you want generated:

    ```yaml
    ---
    types:
      - name: MyGraphQLTypeName
      - name: AnotherTypeInGraphQL
        createAs: map[string]int
    ```

4.  Add a generation command inside the `main.go` (or equivalent)

    ```go
    // Package CoolPackage provides cool stuff, based on generated types
    //go:generate tutone generate -p $GOPACKAGE
    package CoolPackage
    // ... implementation ...
    ```

5.  Run `go generate`
6.  Add the `./path/to/package/types.go` file to your repo

# Configuration

## Command Flags

Flags for running the typegen command:

| Flag                | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-c`                | Path to a configuration file (default ".tutone.yml")                           |
| `-p <Package Name>` | Package name used within the generated file. Overrides the configuration file. |
| `-v`                | Enable verbose logging                                                         |
| `-h`                | Tutone help                                                     |

## Configuration File

An example configuration can be found in [this project repo][example_config].

A configuration file is meant to represent a single project, with
specifications for which parts of the schema to process.

Please see the [config documentation][pkg_go_dev] for details about specific fields.

### Packages

The `packages` field in the configuration contains the details about which
types and mutations to include from the schema, and where the package is located.

| Name       | Required | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | Yes      | The name of the package                                                 |
| `path`       | Yes      | Name of the package the output file will be part of (see `-p` flag)     |
| `generators` | Yes      | A list of generator names from the `generators` field                   |
| `mutations`  | No       | A list of mutations from which to infer types                           |
| `types`      | No       | A list of types from which to start expanding the inferred set of types |

<br>

#### Type Configuration

To fine-tune the types that are created, or not create them at all, the
following options are supported:

| Name                  | Required | Description |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `name`                | Yes      | Name of the type to match |
| `create_as`           | No       | Used when creating a new scalar type to determine which Go type to use. |
| `field_type_override` | No       | Golang type to override whatever the default detected type would be for a given field. |
| `interface_methods`   | No       | List of additional methods that are added to an interface definition. The methods are not defined in the code, so must be implemented by the user. |
| `skip_type_create`    | No       | Allows the user to skip creating a type. |
| `generate_struct_getters` | No | Enables the auto-generation of field getters for all fields on a struct |
| `struct_tags` | No | Allows the user to customize struct tags for the fields on a struct. JSON tags are applied by default.

<br>

### Generators

The `generators` field is used to describe a given generator.  The generator is
where the bulk of the work is done.  Note that the configuration name
referenced must match the name of the attached generated in the
`pkg/generate/generate.go` file.

The generator configuration specifies details about how the generator should adjust the output of the work.

| Name     | Required | Description                                                                  |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | Yes      | The name of the generator used in `pkg/generate/generate.go` file            |
| `fileName` | No       | The name of the target output file that is to be generated. Default is autogenerated based on package name. |
| `templateDir` | No       | The path to the directory that contains the code generation Go templates. For example, the `typegen` generator has different templates for code generation than the `command` generator. |
| `templateName` | No       | The name of the template to use within the `templateDir`. |
| `templateURL` | No       | A URL to a downloadable file to use as a Go template. Use one of `templateDir` *or* `templateURL`, not both. |

**The commonly used generators are the following:**

1. `typegen` - The most commonly used generator. This generator is responsible for generating Go types based on a specified GraphQL API's introspection endpoint query. In New Relic's case, we introspect our NerdGraph API and use the returned GraphQL types to generate corresponding types in Golang.
2. `nerdgraphclient` - This generator is responsible for generating feature code in `newrelic-client-go`. An example of a fully generated feature can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-client-go/blob/main/pkg/cloud/cloud_api.go" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br>

## Templates

Example templates are available in the [templates/<generator>](templates/) directory, and are dynamically loaded from your project.

* Rendered using [text/template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
* Additional pipeline functions from [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
